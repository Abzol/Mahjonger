Mahjonger
=========

A cross-platform mahjong client. I've been meaning to do this for a while.

I honestly have no idea why WindowManager is a singleton. I was in bed while i wrote that.

If someone would take the time to add the required libs as subrepos or something(?) I'd be very thankful and I promise to write them a personal thank you message.
Just don't ask me what those libs are. I've fought #038c far too long by now.

As the famous Hakurou Shirou once said, "Vivisect my dick and hit it with a hammer".
